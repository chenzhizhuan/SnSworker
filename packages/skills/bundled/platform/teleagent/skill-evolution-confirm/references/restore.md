# Restore Workflow

This workflow is mandatory whenever the user explicitly asks to restore, roll back, undo, or revert a previously accepted Skill evolution.

## Mandatory boundary

Before responding to the Restore request or calling `skill_evolution_resolve`, read this document in full.

Never reconstruct this workflow from memory. Never improvise an alternative Restore flow. Never call `skill_evolution_resolve` with `action="restore"` before reading this document.

## 1. Identify the Skill and receipt

Determine the target Skill from the user's request. Look for the exact rollback receipt in the current conversation context. The receipt is shown after a successful Accept.

If the receipt is absent, do not call the tool. Ask the user:

> 我在当前上下文中找不到这次变更的回退凭证。请从当时“已接受变更”的消息中复制凭证给我。

Never guess, construct, alter, or substitute a receipt.

## 2. Execute the first Restore attempt

When both the Skill name and exact receipt are known, call `skill_evolution_resolve` with:

- `action="restore"`
- `skillName="<skillName>"`
- `receipt="<exact receipt>"`
- omit `replaceExisting`, or set it to `false`

The tool checks the current single backup and immediately restores when the request is unambiguous. Do not ask for an extra confirmation before this first call: the user's explicit Restore request is the authorization.

## 3. Unavailable Restore

If the tool returns `restored=false`, report its exact reason and state that no Skill was modified.

For `receipt_mismatch`, show `currentBackupCreatedAt` when present and explain that a later backup has replaced the requested rollback opportunity. Never offer to restore the current backup instead. Never retry with another receipt.

For `legacy_backup_unsupported`, explain that the backup predates rollback receipts and cannot be matched safely.

For `live_skill_missing`, explain that the current formal Skill is absent and a patch rollback cannot be applied safely.

## 4. Delete Restore conflict

If the tool returns `reason="live_skill_conflict"`, the deleted Skill's old name is currently occupied by another formal Skill. The first call has not changed any files.

Present exactly two choices:

1. Replace the current same-name Skill and restore the backup.
2. Cancel the Restore.

Clearly warn that replacement permanently discards all content in the current same-name Skill.

If the user explicitly chooses replacement, call the same tool again with the same `skillName` and `receipt`, plus `replaceExisting=true`.

If the user cancels or gives an ambiguous response, do not call the tool again. Never set `replaceExisting=true` on the first Restore attempt or without explicit approval after `live_skill_conflict`.

## 5. Successful Restore

Report the `operation` returned by the tool.

- `patch`: state that the Skill was restored from the backup and later formal-Skill modifications were overwritten.
- `create`: state that the Skill created by the accepted evolution was removed. If `alreadyAbsent=true`, state that it was already absent and the receipt was consumed.
- `delete`: state that the deleted Skill was restored. If `replacedExisting=true`, also state that the conflicting same-name Skill was replaced as explicitly authorized.

The single backup is consumed after a successful Restore. Do not claim that the same receipt or older versions remain recoverable.
